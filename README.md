🧱 MemeStream App
✅ Step 1: Create Your Own RESTful API (as per POE)
🔧 Stack Suggestion: Node.js + Express + MongoDB Atlas
Create a backend folder in your project (/MemeStream/01-RestfulAPI)

Set up Express server:

npm init -y
npm install express mongoose cors dotenv
Build API with endpoints:

POST /memes – saves meme data
GET /memes – fetches all memes
GET /memes?userId=... – fetches memes by user
Connect to MongoDB Atlas or local MongoDB

Test with Postman

Host using Render, Railway, or Firebase Cloud Functions

✅ Now you meet the “Create and host your own API connected to a database” requirement
